                <h5>Token Powered websites</h5>
                <p>
                  Token powered websites allow you to monetize your content in a
                  new and unique way. By creating gated websites that can only
                  be accessed with your own non-fungible token (NFT) or other
                  digital token, you can create a new way for users to connect
                  with and support your work. This can provide a new source of
                  revenue for your content and give you more control over how it
                  is shared and accessed. With token powered websites, you can
                  create a truly immersive and interactive experience for your
                  audience.

                <h5>Complimentary NFC</h5>
                <p>
                  As a special bonus for our customers, we offer a complimentary
                  NFC chip to those who sign up for a one-year in-app
                  subscription. This NFC chip will be mailed directly to you and
                  can be used to share all of the information and content that
                  you upload to your Swop website. With this NFC chip, you can
                  easily share your website and all of its contents with others
                  by simply tapping your device against another NFC-enabled
                  device. This is a convenient and quick way to share your work
                  and connect with your audience.

                <p>
                  As a premium member, you can customize your Quick Response
                  (QR) code with your own logo and colors. Our QR codes are
                  dynamic, meaning they will automatically update as your
                  content changes. This is an advantage over traditional static
                  QR codes, which do not update and may become outdated. Our
                  customizable and dynamic QR codes provide an effective way to
                  share your content and connect with your audience.
